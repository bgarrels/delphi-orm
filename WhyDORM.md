# You could benefit from DORM if... #

  * You want to use an ORM
  * You want to (or you must) keep your database unchanged
  * You want to ensure persistence ignorance
  * You want to know what happens "under the hood"
  * You want "down to the metal" access for tweaking sake
  * You want to persist PODOs
  * You want to avoid SQL quirks
  * You need commercial support if needed
